# FlaPosTry
connection flask to a postgre db on render from a tutorial. The tutorial did a lot for it but i still had to mess with it for hourssssssssss, as always

it currently works tho! 

if you go to flapostry.onrender.com and the add  "/add/anyName it will add the name

if you just visit flapostry.onrender.com it will show the list of names added
